1. Schedule the Backburner worker to start on boot. Add these lines to /etc/rc.local

sh '/home/deploy/dedicatedmaps/start_worker.sh'
exit 0

2. Schedule the AIS feed to start on boot. Create the file feeds.service in /lib/systemd/system and save this inside. The path to ddscripts/ais/feeds.py must be valid.
